# RandomYoutubeVideo
PHP script that uses the YouTube API and a user defined list to get random youtube videos and play them full screen


To use this, copy all files into a directory served by your webserver, add your api key to the config.php file and then go to that directory/edit.php in a web browser to add or remove videos.  You can password protect this file using basic authentication in your webserver

Once you have your video list made, go to the web directory in your browser and watch random videos from that list in full screen.  Refresh to get a new one.

You can not use this without a YouTube API key, more information on that here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application
